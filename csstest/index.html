            <p><strong>Samuel Taylor Coleridge</strong>
            (21 October 1772 – 25 July 1834) was an English 
            poet, literary critic, philosopher and theologian 
            who, with his friend <strong>William Wordsworth</strong>, was a
             founder of the Romantic Movement in England 
             and a member of the Lake Poets. He also shared volumes and collaborated with <strong>Charles Lamb</strong>, 
             <strong>Robert Southey</strong>, and <strong>Charles Lloyd</strong>. </p>
             
             <p>He wrote the poems <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em> and <em>Kubla 
             Khan</em>, as well as the major prose work <em>Biographia 
             Literaria</em>. His critical work, especially on 
             William Shakespeare, was highly influential, 
             and he helped introduce German idealist philosophy 
             to English-speaking culture. </p> 
             
             <p>Coleridge coined many 
             familiar words and phrases, including <em>suspension of 
             disbelief</em>. He had a major influence on <strong>Ralph Waldo 
             Emerson</strong> and American transcendentalism.</p>

             <p>Throughout his adult life Coleridge had crippling bouts of anxiety 
             and depression; it has been speculated that he had bipolar disorder, 
             which had not been defined during his lifetime. He was physically unhealthy, 
             which may have stemmed from a bout of rheumatic fever and other childhood 
             illnesses. He was treated for these conditions with laudanum, which fostered 
             a lifelong opium addiction.</p>
